# Java_data_structure_and_algorithms
My implementation of common-used data structures and algorithms in Java.   
Hope it would be helpful for me to practice Java programming. (And for doing leetcode questions!)   
***
## Basic
***
~~Single linked list~~  
Quick sort and merge sort  
Find kth element in sorted array  
Find kth element in unsorted array - O(n^2)  
Hash table (Api)  
Heap  
Tree  
Red black tree  
Graph - Adjacent list  
DFS & BFS  
Dijkstra  
Minimum spanning tree  
KMP  
BM  

## Advanced
***
Lasvegas quick sort - O(nlogn)  
Radix sort  
Find kth element in unsorted array - O(n)  
Skip table  
Fib heap  
Van Emde Trees  
B tree  
Segment tree  
Union-find algorithm in disjoint set
